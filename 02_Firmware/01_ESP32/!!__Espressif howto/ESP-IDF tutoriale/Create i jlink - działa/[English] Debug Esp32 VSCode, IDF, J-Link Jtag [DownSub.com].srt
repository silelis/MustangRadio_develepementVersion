00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:06,180
Hello everyone, so today we're going to

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,179
another video, so I decided. So today,

3
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:12,179


4
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,120
I'm going to configure The Burger, I'm going to use the d-link together with espius,

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,699
so with that we can set the

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:25,859
breakbonds, stop, look at the

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,560
variables, how are they?  the state of the

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,040
variables within UESP, right, so that's

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:33,420
what we're going to do today, so we're going to

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,100
do this configuration and we're going to take a

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,280
project that we had already done

12
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,140
in the previous video

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,899
and we're going to do some testing there, so let's get

14
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:45,140
started.

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,120
So this one is the  project that we

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
had done so in the previous video

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,640
I enlarged it a little here since

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,180
we have this area to

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,880
work with so I'm using

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,159


21
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,580
a d-link

22
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,500
and here we have to make some

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,020
settings within Visual Studio, right,

24
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:28,880
to be able to  it identifies this

25
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,360
one The Burger here, right, along with Open

26
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,079
ocd, right, and I managed to debug the esp so

27
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,780
in the settings here we will get

28
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:42,720
first thing we will come here, right And we

29
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,140
will define here our our

30
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,500
flash method here as gateg

31
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,380
doing this I  I had commented about the

32
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,119
configuration files here today we

33
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:56,399
are going to change them so by doing this

34
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,860
in sevenths it will put this

35
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,320
option here right then in yours there will

36
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,000
be this guy here who is that kit

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
that we configured there when

38
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,740
we created the  project, so this guy

39
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,419
here, we're not going to use him because

40
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:12,060
we don't have this kit,

41
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:16,620
right

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,440


43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,780


44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,840
?  link and here we

45
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,620
will put our target as the s32 If you

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,480
have another computer, for example, there we will

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,980
put the target of the computer you

48
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,319
have, so I have the kit here,

49
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,020
my kit is an esp 32, I will put it

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,300
here and here  We don't need to touch

51
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,640
anything else so we give it a control

52
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,459


53
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:47,760


54
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920


55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360


56
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,180


57
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,480
Burgers only

58
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,160
has this Launcher which is this

59
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
configuration here So we go

60
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,540
I'm going to deduct it here

61
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:09,180
and then here you will see that it goes

62
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,519
when I press control S here it

63
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,319
will appear that the configurations o

64
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,099
esp Open the CD which  this is mine here,

65
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,480
so within these settings

66
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,239
we will have the type of The Burger,

67
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:25,140
right, which is CPP, the Burger, here will

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,900
be the type of the request, here where

69
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,420
our build folder is, right, it will be inside

70
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,140
the project, here, build, where will it go?  our program will be

71
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,180
build

72
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,519
here

73
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,200
So this guy here will change

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,060
according to the name of your project

75
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,879
so within build there will be a file

76
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,200
there with the name of Elf with a dot Elf there

77
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:53,220
that lets me see where this guy

78
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,319
is here.  So this one is the first

79
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,659
project,

80
00:03:57,659 --> 00:03:59,819
if I click on it just to select it, it's

81
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:02,940
not this guy here,

82
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,739
so this one will be the name of

83
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:06,299
your project, and then you'll

84
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:08,060
put

85
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,319
this pointing to this

86
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,840
workspace variable here, the build  the name of

87
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,939
your project, right? In my case, this is the

88
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,579
first project, dot Elf, which will be the

89
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:20,160
program where he will attack mi

90
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
the Burger Pet, this guy here will also

91
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
be according to

92
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,880
your installation, you can see

93
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,639
that he  it's here inside my user, right, I

94
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,520
know

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,680
Vick's HBR users, it would be there, right,

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,060
specific point where I did the

97
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,259
installation, right, the specific one

98
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:44,160
here depends on the version you're going to

99
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,840
use, you can see that here mine,

100
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,800
I have two

101
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:53,180
ready, just show them here

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,460
Oh mine I have two I have version

103
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,979
4 which is this one and I have version 5

104
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:00,960
as I'm using version 5 I came

105
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,419
to this one from below so it will go

106
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:06,360
here in this 11.2 inside this guy here

107
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,780
we will have the extensions  there, the Bin folder

108
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,220


109
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,500
and here we will take and look for

110
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:19,680
this file here which is an exz point

111
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,620
which will then be this guy here

112
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,720
that we will use for s32 and

113
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,180
from there we will have to do

114
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,860
a  configuration, then in the

115
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,419
J link file, which is this guy here,

116
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:37,440
initially he will only have this

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,419
configuration of the link adaptor, we

118
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:41,280
will put this guy's Speed ​​where

119
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,320
he will work and the

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,180
transport layer, so we will put

121
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,919
a file like this  file it is there within

122
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:52,440
the installation so this can change

123
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,780
according to the installation in my case

124
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,180
here it is within my user specific point we

125
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,800


126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,220
go here in Tools we will look

127
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,759
here for opinion CD here also same

128
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,560
thing as I have two versions I

129
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:10,680
I have version 4.4 and version 5, I have

130
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,840
two installations here of their pince, they have

131
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,340
different versions, so as I'm

132
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,800
using it, let's go to this version,

133
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,080
opinion CD

134
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:21,199
share

135
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,620
Open CD script and here within the

136
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,259
interface we will have the d-lin that

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,000
goes  have some other interface so it's

138
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,020
this file here that we're going to

139
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,060
change, I already have it open here

140
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,220
inside visual studio you can see

141
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,639
that the address here is the same so just

142
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,139
close it here And this here was the other

143
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,940
file which is what  we

144
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,300
pointed it out inside the Launcher, inside this

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,300
guy from seventh

146
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:50,039
32 CFG, this one we don't need to

147
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:52,259
touch, but if anyone wants to take a

148
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:54,539
look at it, we'll come back here

149
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,580
inside

150
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,639
it's

151
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,380
target scripts and here we'll have the

152
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,400
computers that  we have then we have

153
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,880
another 32 C2 S3 then we can if you have a

154
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,100
different computer than the one I have here for

155
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,539
example if the person has a C2 they will

156
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:14,699
select this one

157
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:17,520
doing this then we will go to

158
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,280
the commands that Visual Studio will

159
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,460
send it to connect This guy there

160
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,199
so here we will say that the

161
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,919
target is the local domain, right on port 333

162
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:32,460
that when I start adb it will

163
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,919
create some ports for the bug So

164
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,199
we will create a server it will

165
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,639
we will connect  with Visual Studio

166
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,520
on this server, here is a watch point, right

167
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
here, monitor to give a route and

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,580
flush the Rex, we make these

169
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,060
settings then we will be

170
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:53,220
able to publish it, we will have to

171
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,020
make some changes to the Drive there

172
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,639
too, right?

173
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,539
jailink so I'll leave everything there in the

174
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,699
description I'll leave a link to

175
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:04,580
these files here with

176
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,120
and with the driver files there So

177
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,819
let me take a look here so

178
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:15,800
we'll use this USB Tool drivers

179
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:25,099
when you

180
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:28,919
come and put the d-link in  In

181
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:30,419
your Windows, it will have this driver here,

182
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:31,800


183
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,320
but this driver will not work

184
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
with adb, we will have to come here, I

185
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,979
came here, select, we will

186
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,380
select this Win USB

187
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,480
so it can work, so

188
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,060
we will come here,  little program comes

189
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,160
Boot it to the USB it will appear

190
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,660
here as in USB you can take a close up

191
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,700
from there it

192
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,640
is practically all configured Let's

193
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,380
do a test but if we see

194
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,300
our

195
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,339
hello world here also here we will press

196
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,899
F5 and we will see what  what will happen

197
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,040
let's see if everything will happen ok if

198
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,940
it will generate an error

199
00:09:23,779 --> 00:09:27,660
then we had an error

200
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,980
It is saying that it was unable to

201
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:32,279
connect let's go why did this happen

202
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,580
because our Open ocd is

203
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,920
not running

204
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,600
so you saw it there  after I

205
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,160
clicked it, it runs, it stays here with

206
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,980
this little Green mark Here it says

207
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,019
that it's running So let's press this

208
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,320
five again,

209
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,760
it couldn't start the bug, I'll

210
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,279
press F5 again, let's see if

211
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:59,420
it can connect

212
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,300
now.  When he connects, sometimes he

213
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,160
can't connect to the server, which did

214
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
n't even happen to me, when he

215
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,060
connects this Veloso bar where it

216
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,100
will turn orange, then you know that The

217
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,200
banner is connected And we're

218
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,000
already starting to be able to stop within the

219
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,820
code  oh, so here I'm going to send it

220
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,140
forward, it's going to stop at this other

221
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,600
breakpoint that I put down there,

222
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,459
you can see here that we

223
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:29,399
can already identify that the i, right?

224
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:31,680


225
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,779


226
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,480
We can now see

227
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,100
what's inside these variables

228
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,959
here, we can also put them

229
00:10:39,959 --> 00:10:42,360
for inspection, right?

230
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,860
Let me put a variable here, I

231
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,980
'll need the name,

232
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,600
put it here for the line to inspect this one, I got

233
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,720


234
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:55,279
the name wrong, let's delete it, let's

235
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:59,279
go

236
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,380
chip  info so here we can see, you can

237
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,959
monitor each variable, we

238
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,459
can see the call stack, so

239
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,160
what is happening in each trade

240
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,380
like

241
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:12,600
this, what I wanted to demonstrate

242
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,500
to you was this configuration, then,

243
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,240
of esp

244
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,680
on the display platform  studio of how

245
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,180
we configure Visual Studio to

246
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,480
be able to open the CD and

247
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,760
connect to it, right, make the open

248
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,920
CD connect to the esp so that we can

249
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,700
connect to this Open ocv show that how

250
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,860
it works so the variables

251
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,600
there  what we can see from

252
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,720
esp

253
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,820
through this the Burger

254
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,680
and I leave it there so thank you very much

and share it with people, give it a like,

257
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,839
