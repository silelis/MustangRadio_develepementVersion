00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,440
Hello everyone, so this is our

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,019
first video here,

3
00:00:09,019 --> 00:00:11,639
I'm going to talk a little about the

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:14,460
motivations that led me to record this

5
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,340
video here, right?

6
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,840


7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,380


8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,720
I had to find

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:30,560
material and things like that in Portuguese

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,719
when programming the apps, so the idea was to

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:37,980
make some tutorials, I don't know

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,840
yet how many there will be, but we'll

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,300
start from the beginning, from the installation

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,420
of the visual studio to the installation of the IDF Plugin

15
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:46,980


16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,260
and it will  then following with some

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,260
implementations there that I will end up

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:54,300
deciding during the

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,120
execution of the

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,399
videos. So this first one we will

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,260
do then the installation of Visual

22
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,479
Studio and the installation of IDF in Visual

23
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
Studio

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,799
then in Visual Studio we will download it

25
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:12,659
from this website  Here is the Visual Studio that

26
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,040
we are going to use, we are going to

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,280
download it here, as I already downloaded it, I am just

28
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,360
going to install it, so

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,420
we go here, accept the terms,

30
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:27,299
I will install everything in the directories that are

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:30,740
standard for Visual Studio,

32
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,180
I always like it  to add these two

33
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,220
options here

34
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,100
they are, when you

35
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,420
right-click on the desktop, they

36
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,759
place Visual Studio in the

37
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,420
context menu

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,700
and here we do the installation. So

39
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,180
let's wait to

40
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:06,840
fix my window here,

41
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,380
adjust it to the  video size

42
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,140
So this here is the Visual

43
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,500
Studio interface which is where we will work,

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,840
it comes out here on a welcome screen and

45
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,700
from there we will come here and

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,860
start installing the plugins so

47
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,020
we will use

48
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,480
the plugins  there is a very easy installation

49
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,459
here so we can start working

50
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:32,220
with this one we will need some

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,280
plugins And then we will look for the

52
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,739
first one here which is IDF we will

53
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,900
look for IDF here and this first

54
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,480
option here so

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,680
don't install me

56
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,060
So, to install this

57
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,160
first guy here,

58
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,379
we will take it and start

59
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,420
configuring this plugin. So

60
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,819
we will press the F1 key here.

61
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:01,620
And then this option will appear here,

62
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,680
configure spdf, we will click

63
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,940
here, we have three options

64
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:17,340
The ideal would be for us to use something

65
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,220
that if we already have here, right?

66
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,860
So as I had already installed

67
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,140
another version here I could use this one

68
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,819
but I'm going to put Express right

69
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,260
here and we'll get it What version

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:36,060
do we want to get DF  right, I

71
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,360
'm going to put version 5.0 here, the

72
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,459
directories where it will save it, right? And here

73
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,019
will be the repository from where it will

74
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:46,680
download, so it will download version 5 from github,

75
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,299


76
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,099
which is a release, and it will save it

77
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,360
in these folders here

78
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,120
from there onwards.  We are now going to wait

79
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,260
for this guy to download all

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,019
the plugins here, here all the tools

81
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:06,379
he needs

82
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,960
So guys, as soon as he configures it,

83
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,040
he will show us this message

84
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,000
here and we already have it The plugin is already

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
practically configured,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,919
he will probably ask us  a few more plugins

87
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,020
later for us to install, I already

88
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,040
installed the C part here, but right? It should contain

89
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,620
containers, which are some plugins that

90
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,320
IDF uses.

91
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,139
But let's go now,

92
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:23,160
it will show us this

93
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,800
welcome screen, so let's now configure

94
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,360
our first project here  let's

95
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,759
create a new project here so we

96
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,919
're going to press F1 and it's going to open this

97
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,960
little screen here we're going to type IDF there

98
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,840
PDF and here Type thousand it's going to

99
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,900
appear there, the new Project we're going to

100
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,539
click on this guy here

101
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:49,680
we're going to give a  name for our

102
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,600
project so

103
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,100
our project will be the first

104
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,240
project

105
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,580
pay attention here as there are some

106
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,660
details that can cause a lot of

107
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,220
problems for us to have to configure

108
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,440


109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,060
spaces in the name of the project then here it is very

110
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,020
bad, so try not to leave

111
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,320
spaces here put the underline  Or put a

112
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,319
camera Case something like that

113
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:23,780
in the project in the

114
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:28,199
project there so as not to leave spaces

115
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,060
there

116
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,680
here the directory it will save or just

117
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,419
go to documents s32 Project

118
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,860
we select the development board here

119
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,780
So I'm going to launch this

120
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,660
egg kit to the port That would be where it is

121
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,120
connected And  this space here we use

122
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,460
to place a component the

123
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,960
components we will deal with in the video

124
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,340
later on there will be another

125
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:52,680
content there will be a video just dealing

126
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,199
with them there on how we place

127
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,600
these components within our

128
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,280
project for now we will  leave it

129
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,160
empty let's click on choose the

130
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,080
template

131
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,780
here it presents us with three templates

132
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,080
or if we want to get it from the IDF

133
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,060
it has several examples here it is, I'll

134
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,919
take it let me

135
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,120
take a look at this template

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,180
app here it is an empty template

137
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,860
I generally use it to start my  projects

138
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,300
But it would be very interesting if we

139
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:29,400
came here and watched hello

140
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,840
world, right?

141
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,580
Let's create from hello world

142
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:33,660
So we're going to create a new project

143
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,919
from hello world

144
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,840
just so we can demonstrate it here so

145
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,419
he already created this project there  he created it

146
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,979
in those folders there and that one is asking

147
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:47,819
me to open Visual Studio there

148
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:51,479
inside that folder So this here is

149
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,520
our project window so we

150
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,860
can see here

151
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,220
that there is a whole structure that

152
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:02,400
our IDF plugin there created so there is

153
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,259
here within the vsco point of some

154
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,860
configuration files

155
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:10,319
Jason so we will work

156
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,900
on them later for now we

157
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,759
will not change anything in it we will leave everything the

158
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,280
default configuration as it

159
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:21,300
is inside me Hello Word So this

160
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,620
guy he already does the  import of

161
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,319
some libraries from the system

162
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:28,860
and from here in the mother app it will

163
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,780
print a hello world and here it will

164
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,459
get some information from esp, right it

165
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:40,580
will print here the size of the memory

166
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,200
when we have it here it will

167
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,300
count up to 10 seconds  it will slow down

168
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,420
So we'll take it here, I'll

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,860
close these messages here because I don't

170
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,740
want to install these extensions here,

171
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,899
so we'll take it here, we'll

172
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:55,980
configure our Extra here, right, so

173
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,899
here we configure the port, right, I already

174
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,580
had it configured there, so it's with  three

175
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,080
for this project here we configure

176
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,580
the esc that we have so first

177
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,440
project it will show that the list

178
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,019
So mine is an s32 from this kit

179
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,560
here we can clean the

180
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,360
project if we have already seen

181
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,040
something  here we can do a

182
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,080
Clean here and it deletes that Build folder

183
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320


184
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,320
here in this guy here he records

185
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,180
here we will configure the

186
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,100
very important recording method so ours it will

187
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,140
be by art we will record it

188
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,080
by serial with 3

esp responses that it is sending through the terminal and
